# Project ELEMENTIA

An early build of a Fire Emblem/Advance Wars-like game developed in C++ using the Allegro 4 library. This project is no longer in development.

Some images assets used in development were taken from third-party games for testing, I do not claim to own them.

A compiled version for Windows users is available through the `Elementia.exe` file.
